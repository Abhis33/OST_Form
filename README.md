# OST_Form
This is a form I built according to guidelines by OST and my own artistic touches.
Bootstrap was used along with JQuery and the following plugins-
1. Bootstrap-DatePicker
2. popper
3. Moment

Validator (Inbuilt plugin) was used for validating input field conditions.
PopOver (Inbuilt plugin) was used for help messages (pop-up box).

The success.html file is an extra file just to show the form is submitted without any errors.
